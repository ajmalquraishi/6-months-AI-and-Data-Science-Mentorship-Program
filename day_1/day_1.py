# Lists vs. Tuples:

# Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation, whereas tuples are immutable, and their elements cannot be changed.
# Lists are defined using square brackets
list1=[1,"Ajmal","Karachi"],
#Lists are mutable
# Tuples are defined using parentheses
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3),
# Tuples are immutable
#Lists are generally used for collections of similar items that may need to be modified, while tuples are used for collections of heterogeneous items that should remain constant.
#Lists vs. Sets:
#Lists allow duplicate elements and maintain order, while sets do not allow duplicates and do not guarantee order.
list1=[1,"Ajmal","Karachi"],
#Sets are immutable
set1 ={1,2,3},
#Lists vs. Dictionaries:
#Lists are ordered collections of items accessed by their index (integer positions), while dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
list1=[1,"Ajmal","Karachi"],
#Dictionaries are mutable
dic1={'name':'Ajmal','age':25,}
#Dictionaries have key-value pairs.

# Sets vs. Dictionaries:
# Sets are collections of unique elements without key-value pairs, while dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
set1 ={1,2,3},

dic1={'name':'Ajmal','age':25,}
# Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
